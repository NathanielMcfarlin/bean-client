# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# The Bean: A Coffee Shop App
  
The Bean is a full-stack capstone project developed to demonstrate the skills acquired during my time at Nashville Software School. The aim was to create an intuitive coffee shop app that provides users with a realistic ordering experience.

## Description
The app allows users to browse a variety of drink options, customize their preferences, add items to their cart, and manage their orders seamlessly. Leveraging Python and Django on the back-end, the app efficiently handles data requests, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used
- Front-end: JavaScript, CSS, HTML, React
- Back-end: Python, Django
- Database: SQLite

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository: git clone git@github.com:NathanielMcfarlin/bean-client.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd the-bean
3. Install dependencies: npm install
4. Run the server: npm run dev
 ### Usage
1. Upon launching the app, users can browse through available drink options.
2. Select desired drinks and customize preferences as needed.
3. Add items to the cart for easy tracking.
4. Manage orders by updating or removing items from the cart.
5. Clear the cart entirely if desired.
### Future Improvements
- Enhance the user interface with responsive design.
- Integrate payment processing for online orders.
